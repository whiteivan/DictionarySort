This program is one of the first ones I wrote for real-world usage.

While studying English, I used to jot down all unfamiliar words on my phone. Over time, I accumulated around 1000 words. However, since I recorded them over time, they were not in alphabetical order. That's why I created this program.

It runs from the console and takes two arguments: the file with the original dictionary and the file where the result should be saved. Additionally, this program removes duplicates, which helped me in a work task related to NLU (Natural Language Understanding) filling.
